# ISMS Dashboard Project Status

## Project Overview
The ISMS Dashboard is a comprehensive web application for managing ISO 27001 compliance. The application is built using Next.js with React and TypeScript, and uses Supabase as its backend database.

## Database Structure
The database contains several key tables for managing ISO compliance:

- **projects**: Main projects being managed in the system
- **boundaries**: Security boundaries within each project
- **controls**: ISO 27001 controls
- **boundary_controls**: Mapping between boundaries and controls (with applicable flag)
- **stakeholders**: Project stakeholders
- **evidence**: Evidence for control implementations
- **gaps**: Gap analysis for controls
- **risk_assessments**: Risk assessments related to controls and gaps
- **questionnaire_questions** and **project_questionnaire_answers**: For compliance questionnaires

## Completed Features

### 1. Authentication System
- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Session management

### 2. Project Management
- Project creation and editing
- Project details view
- Project status tracking
- Progress indicators

### 3. Boundaries Management
- Adding/editing boundaries
- Assigning controls to boundaries
- Boundary details view

### 4. Statement of Applicability (SOA)
- Drag-and-drop interface for assigning controls to boundaries
- Toggle for marking controls as applicable or not applicable
- Control attribution and justification
- SOA completion tracking
- UI improvements with toggle to view applicable vs non-applicable controls

### 5. Evidence and Gap Management
- Evidence uploading and management
- Gap identification and tracking
- Compliance assessment

### 6. Stakeholder Management
- Adding and managing stakeholders
- Role assignment
- Responsibility tracking

### 7. Questionnaire System
- Compliance questionnaires
- Answer tracking

### 8. Risk Assessment
- Threat scenario management
- Risk assessment forms
- Risk visualization

### 9. Reporting
- CRQ summary reports
- MITRE Attack mapping
- Risk graphs

## Recent Improvements

We've recently enhanced the Statement of Applicability (SOA) module with the following features:

1. **Toggle View for Applicable/Non-Applicable Controls**: Added a switch UI element that allows users to toggle between viewing:
   - Applicable controls (default view)
   - Non-applicable controls

2. **Improved Control Management**: Enhanced the UI to allow users to:
   - Mark controls as applicable/non-applicable directly from either view
   - Add justification for inclusion/exclusion
   - Toggle the applicability status with visual indicators

3. **Database Integration**: Verified that the system is correctly storing both applicable and non-applicable controls in the database, with the `is_applicable` flag correctly set.

## Future Tasks

### 1. User Interface Enhancements
- Improve overall UI/UX design
- Implement dark mode
- Add more interactive visualizations
- Enhance mobile responsiveness

### 2. Reporting Capabilities
- Enhance reporting features
- Add export functionality (PDF, Excel)
- Create executive dashboard
- Add more visualization options

### 3. Integration Capabilities
- Integrate with other security tools
- Add API endpoints for external access
- Implement webhooks for notifications

### 4. Compliance Improvements
- Add support for other compliance frameworks
- Enhance control mapping across frameworks
- Add more detailed compliance tracking

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Optimize database queries
- Implement caching where appropriate
- Improve loading times for large datasets

### 6. Specific Module Enhancements
- **SOA Module**: Add bulk operations for control applicability
- **Evidence Module**: Enhance file management capabilities
- **Risk Module**: Improve risk calculation algorithms
- **Gap Management**: Add automated recommendations

## Project Structure
The codebase follows a typical Next.js structure with:

- `src/app`: Next.js app router pages
- `src/components`: Reusable React components
- `src/services`: Backend service functions
- `src/utils`: Utility functions
- `src/types`: TypeScript type definitions

Key components are organized by feature (boundaries, controls, evidence, etc.) allowing for modular development and maintenance.

## Conclusion
The ISMS Dashboard project has made significant progress in building a comprehensive ISO 27001 compliance management system. Recent improvements to the SOA module have enhanced usability and functionality. The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns, making it maintainable and extensible for future enhancements.
