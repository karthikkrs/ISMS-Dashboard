# Summary of Current Task and Pending Actions

**Goal:** Implement a workflow where modifying data (create, update, delete) within a project phase that has already been marked as "complete" triggers a confirmation dialog. If the user confirms, the modification proceeds, and the phase's completion status is reset to `null`. (Simplified plan, excluding audit trail).

**Progress So Far:**

1.  **Reverted Automatic Reset:** The previous logic that automatically reset phase status upon modification has been removed from all relevant service files:
    *   `src/services/evidence-service.ts`
    *   `src/services/gap-service.ts`
    *   `src/services/boundary-control-service.ts`
    *   `src/services/stakeholder-service.ts`
    *   `src/services/boundary-service.ts`
2.  **Implemented Confirmation Dialogs (Partially):** Confirmation logic using Shadcn's `<AlertDialog>` has been added to the create/update/delete handlers in the following components:
    *   `src/components/evidence-gaps/evidence-form.tsx` (Create Evidence)
    *   `src/components/evidence-gaps/gap-form.tsx` (Create/Update Gap)
    *   `src/components/evidence-gaps/gap-list.tsx` (Delete Gap)
    *   `src/components/boundaries/multi-boundary-form.tsx` (Create/Update Boundary)
    *   `src/components/boundaries/boundaries-table.tsx` (Delete Boundary)
    *   `src/components/stakeholders/stakeholder-form.tsx` (Create/Update Stakeholder)
    *   `src/components/stakeholders/stakeholders-table.tsx` (Delete Stakeholder)
    *   `src/components/soa/soa-dashboard.tsx` (Add/Remove Boundary Control)
    *   **Interrupted:** Attempted to add logic to `src/components/evidence-gaps/compliance-assessment.tsx` (Update Compliance Status), but the process was interrupted after file corruption and restoration attempts.

**Pending Action Items:**

1.  **Fix & Complete `compliance-assessment.tsx`:**
    *   Restore `src/components/evidence-gaps/compliance-assessment.tsx` to its state before the last failed modification attempt.
    *   Re-implement the confirmation dialog logic carefully within the `onSubmit` handler, ensuring correct imports, state management, project status checking, conditional dialog triggering, and calling `updateBoundaryControl` + `unmarkProjectPhaseComplete` upon user confirmation. Ensure the `<Controller>` component is used correctly for the `<Select>` input.
2.  **Final Review & Testing:**
    *   Once `compliance-assessment.tsx` is fixed, perform a final review of all modified components.
    *   Thoroughly test the create, update, and delete actions for each phase (Boundaries, Stakeholders, SOA, Evidence, Gaps) to confirm:
        *   The confirmation dialog appears *only* when modifying a phase already marked as complete.
        *   The modification proceeds *only* after user confirmation in the dialog.
        *   The relevant phase completion status (`*_completed_at`) is correctly reset to `null` in the database upon confirmation and modification.
        *   Modifications proceed directly without confirmation if the phase is not already complete.
