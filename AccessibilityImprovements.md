# Accessibility and Usability Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Modal Dialog Accessibility
- Fixed console error: `DialogContent requires a DialogTitle for the component to be accessible for screen reader users`
- Added proper `DialogDescription` components to all modals for screen reader context
- Ensured all dialog components have proper ARIA attributes through Radix UI implementation

### 2. Scrolling in Modal Dialogs
- Added `ScrollArea` component to the "Assess Risk" dialog content
- Set appropriate heights to enable scrolling for larger content:
  - `max-h-[90vh]` for the dialog container
  - `h-[60vh]` with explicit `overflow-y-auto` for the scrollable area
  - Added `pr-4` padding to ensure content isn't cut off at edges

### 3. Close Button Accessibility
- Removed custom close button to eliminate duplicate close buttons
- Utilizing the built-in close button from Shadcn Dialog component which already has:
  - Proper ARIA attributes
  - Screen reader accessibility text
  - Automatic positioning according to design system

### 4. Form Layout and Organization
- Improved dialog header layout with flex positioning
- Added padding to scrollable content for better readability
- Ensured form controls maintain proper spacing within the scrollable area

### 5. Component Refactoring
- Created a standalone `ThreatScenarioDialog` component to:
  - Prevent nested form tag validation errors
  - Properly encapsulate the threat scenario creation UI
  - Provide consistent dialog behaviors across the application
- Updated references in related components to use the new dialog

## Testing Results
- Build completes successfully with no TypeScript or accessibility errors
- The "Assess Risk" modal now properly displays with scrolling capability
- The "Create New Threat Scenario" dialog properly integrates with risk assessment workflow

## User Feedback Improvements
- Added toast notifications for form submission results:
  - Success toasts for completed actions show at the top-right (using Sonner)
  - Error toasts display when operations fail
  - Implemented in both Risk Assessment and Threat Scenario forms
  - Clear, contextual messages differ between creation and update operations
