# ISO 27001:2022 Controls

This document outlines the ISO 27001:2022 controls used in the ISMS Dashboard application.

## Control Structure

ISO 27001:2022 controls are organized in a hierarchical structure:

1. **Domains (Annexes)** - Top-level categorization (e.g., "A.5 Organizational Controls")
2. **Controls** - Specific requirements within each domain (e.g., "A.5.1 Information security policies")
3. **Implementation Guidance** - Specific measures to implement controls

## Control Domains

ISO 27001:2022 includes the following control domains:

- **A.5: Organizational controls**
- **A.6: People controls** 
- **A.7: Physical controls**
- **A.8: Technological controls**

## Control Applicability

In the Statement of Applicability (SOA), controls can be:

- **Applicable** - Control is relevant to the boundary and must be implemented
- **Not Applicable** - Control is not relevant to the boundary

## Implementation in ISMS Dashboard

In the ISMS Dashboard application:

1. Controls are assigned to boundaries through the SOA interface
2. Each control has:
   - Reference ID (e.g., "A.5.1")
   - Description
   - Domain classification
   
3. For applicable controls, implementation details can be documented:
   - Reason for inclusion
   - Implementation status
   - Evidence of compliance

## SOA Workflow

1. Define organizational boundaries
2. Review all ISO 27001:2022 controls
3. For each boundary, determine which controls are applicable
4. Document reasons for applicability/non-applicability
5. Mark the SOA phase as complete
6. Proceed to evidence collection and gap analysis
