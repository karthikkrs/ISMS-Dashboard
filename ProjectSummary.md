# ISMS Dashboard Project Summary

## Project Overview

The ISMS Dashboard is a comprehensive web application designed to facilitate ISO 27001 compliance management. Built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Supabase, it provides a structured approach to implementing and maintaining an Information Security Management System.

## Architecture

The application follows a modern web architecture:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with React and TypeScript
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL database with RESTful API)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **UI Framework**: Custom components with shadcn/ui

## Key Features

1. **Project Management**
   - Project creation, editing, and tracking
   - Phase completion management
   - Progress visualization

2. **Security Boundaries**
   - Definition of system boundaries
   - Multi-boundary management
   - Asset valuation

3. **Statement of Applicability (SOA)**
   - Drag-and-drop control assignment
   - Toggle view for applicable/non-applicable controls
   - Control applicability justification
   - Control implementation tracking

4. **Evidence Management**
   - Evidence collection and uploading
   - Evidence-to-control mapping
   - File management

5. **Gap Analysis**
   - Gap identification and tracking
   - Severity classification
   - Remediation planning

6. **Risk Assessment**
   - Threat scenario modeling
   - Risk evaluation and calculation
   - MITRE ATT&CK framework integration

7. **Stakeholder Management**
   - Stakeholder definition and tracking
   - Role assignment
   - Responsibility documentation

8. **Compliance Questionnaires**
   - Domain-specific questionnaires
   - Response tracking
   - Evidence linkage

9. **Reporting**
   - Compliance reports
   - Risk visualization
   - Control implementation status

## Recent Accomplishments

The most recent update to the SOA module added significant improvements:

1. **Toggle View for Controls**: Added a switch UI that allows users to easily toggle between viewing applicable and non-applicable controls for each boundary.

2. **Enhanced Control Status Management**: Improved the interface for changing control applicability, with visual indicators and a streamlined workflow.

3. **Database Verification**: Confirmed that the system properly stores both applicable and non-applicable controls in the database with the correct `is_applicable` flag.

## Database Schema

The application uses a relational database with the following core tables:

- **projects**: The central entity that contains all assessment data
- **boundaries**: Security scope definitions within projects
- **controls**: ISO 27001 control requirements
- **boundary_controls**: The mapping between boundaries and controls
- **stakeholders**: Project stakeholders and responsibilities
- **evidence**: Implementation evidence for controls
- **gaps**: Identified control implementation gaps
- **threat_scenarios**: Security threat models
- **risk_assessments**: Risk evaluations for threats and gaps

See [DatabaseSchema.md](./DatabaseSchema.md) for the complete schema with relationships.

## Task Status

The project has successfully implemented all core functionality for ISO 27001 compliance management. A detailed breakdown of completed and future tasks can be found in [TaskList.md](./TaskList.md).

### Key Completed Features:
- User authentication and authorization
- Project and boundary management
- Statement of Applicability (SOA)
- Evidence and gap management
- Risk assessment
- Stakeholder management
- Compliance questionnaires
- Reporting

### Upcoming Features:
- Bulk control operations
- Enhanced reporting and exports
- API integrations
- Additional compliance frameworks

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - Next.js 15.x
  - React 18.x
  - TypeScript 5.x
  - TanStack Query (React Query)
  - React DnD (Drag and Drop)
  
- **UI Components**:
  - Shadcn/UI
  - Lucide Icons
  - Tailwind CSS
  
- **Backend**:
  - Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  - Row-Level Security (RLS)
  - TypeScript Services
  
- **Authentication**:
  - Supabase Auth
  - JWT Tokens
  
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Recharts

## Deployment

The application can be deployed using:
- Vercel (for the Next.js frontend)
- Supabase Cloud (for the database)

## Next Steps

1. **Short-term Improvements**:
   - Add bulk operations for the SOA module
   - Enhance mobile responsiveness
   - Optimize database queries for performance

2. **Medium-term Goals**:
   - Implement export functionality (PDF, Excel)
   - Add dark mode support
   - Create API endpoints for external integrations

3. **Long-term Vision**:
   - Support additional compliance frameworks
   - Implement advanced analytics
   - Add AI-assisted recommendations

## Conclusion

The ISMS Dashboard has established a solid foundation for ISO 27001 compliance management. With its comprehensive feature set and well-structured architecture, it provides significant value for organizations implementing and maintaining their information security management systems. The project's modular design ensures that future enhancements can be implemented efficiently.
